        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi! My name is Oneisha Grant. I just turned 27 years old and I have a
          4 year old son. I am a full time student with a passion for learning
          and growing in the digital world. I have been a freelance website
          designer for about 2 years now, but I grew tired of not being able to
          fully customize websites because I didn't know how to code.
        </p>
        <h2>Why I'm Taking This Course</h2>
        <p>
          I am taking this course to expand my knowledge of web development.
          Before, I was using platforms such as Wix and WordPress. While those
          sites do allow you to customize with HTML and CSS, I couldn't offer my
          clients much more customization than the pre-made templates, or the
          templates I could make myself. I wanted to make real websites. Since
          taking WebD 152 and starting this course, I have gained a deeper
          understanding of how websites work from the ground up. I can't believe
          I even know how to build a webpage from scratch! The most exciting
          part of these courses is overcoming things that once intimidated me. One day I hope to own my own media agency for people looking to build their brand image.
        </p>
        <h2>Prior Experience</h2>
        <p>
          I've made a handful of websites since starting freelance web design.
          My very first client was a non profit animal sanctuary in Arizona. I
          so wish that website was still standing because I put a lot of work
          into it and had so much fun with it! Here is a project I was asked to
          complete for their website:
        </p>
        <video
          controls
          width="500"
          height="500"
          src="videos/project.MOV"
        ></video>
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
          When I am not investing my time into web design/development, I love to:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>Read</li>
        <li>Sew</li>
        <li>Play The Sims</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I've come to a place in my life where I finally have more time to dedicate to figuring out what other things I like to do so I'm excited to explore that. I'm very interested in learning how to hand make leather bags and how to design my own fabric to make clothes. Once I am ready my bags and clothes will be sold on my website.
